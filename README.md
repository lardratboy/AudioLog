# AudioLog

Keep track of which tabs have played audio with this simple yet powerful extension. If you're like most people juggling multiple tabs, you've probably experienced that moment when a random sound plays and you can't figure out which tab is the culprit.

Audio Log solves this problem by maintaining a comprehensive history of all audio activity across your tabs. See exactly which tabs played sounds, when they occurred, and quickly navigate back to the source. No more frantically clicking through dozens of tabs trying to find that mystery audio - just check your audio log and go straight to the tab that made the noise.

Perfect for users who:

* Keep many tabs open simultaneously
* Listen to background music or podcasts while working
* Need to identify unexpected audio sources
* Want to revisit tabs that previously played content

Simple, lightweight, and privacy-focused - Audio Log runs entirely locally and doesn't collect any personal data.
